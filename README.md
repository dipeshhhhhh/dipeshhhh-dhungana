# Python Fundamentals Assignment

This repository contains several tasks completed as part of a Python fundamentals assignment. Each task is saved in its own `.py` file.

## Project Structure

- `data_types.py`: Defines basic variables of different data types, performs simple operations, and stores them in a dictionary.
- `control_structures.py`: Classifies user-entered numbers as positive, negative, or zero using control structures. Supports multiple entries until the user types "exit."
